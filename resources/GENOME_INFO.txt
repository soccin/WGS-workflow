Hi Nicholas!

So my colleague needs to verify some steps for WGS pipeline, I will let you know when I have that! So here to start with:

For the genome file and annotation, they used the ensembl assembly (Sscrofa11.1). The most complete version.
 
Link to pig genome page:

Link to pig genome sequence:
 
https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-110/fasta/sus_scrofa/dna/
 
You want to use this file: Sus_scrofa.Sscrofa11.1.dna.toplevel.fa.gz
 
Link to pig annotation:
 
https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-110/gtf/sus_scrofa/
 
You want to use this file: Sus_scrofa.Sscrofa11.1.110.gtf.gz

Let me know if you have any questions!

Best,
Andreas
